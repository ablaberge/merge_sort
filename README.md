# CS281_Mergesort

This is a basic merge sort in C completed for CS 281 - Architecture and Assembly Language. 

When called, it expects an integer input from the command line which represents the size of the array to be sorted. The program will automatically 
create an array of that size and fill it with random integers such that each integer n is less than the size of the array and greater than or equal to zero. 
If the size of the array is less than or equal to 100, the array will be printed before and after sorting.
